Refinements Based on Workflow

When a dropdown selection is made (e.g., User Type, Device), auto-focus back to the text box for typing in details like extra comments.

Optional Fields for Notes or Extra Info

Include a field at the bottom of the log for free-form notes that the helpdesk user can quickly add during or after the call (e.g., "Extra Info:").

Proposed Workflow Integration Enhancements

Auto-Populated Template

When the user clicks "New Call," auto-insert a template structure in the log:

strcuture:
--- Call [Number] ---
Caller Name:
User Type:
School:
Device:
Problem:
Location:
Notes:
	future addition maybe
	
Add Call Status

Add a "Call Status" dropdown with options like:
Solved Remotely
Escalated to Technician
Pending
Follow-Up Required
This can help with ticket generation or tracking unresolved calls.

UI Improvements for the Workflow
Reorganize Buttons for Flow

Group buttons into "Call Actions" (New Call, Caller Name, Computer Name) and "App Actions" (Save Log, Open Logs Folder, Exit) for clarity.

Place the "New Call" button prominently at the top left since it's the first action in the workflow.

Simplify Log Output

Ensure each action (dropdown selection, button click) appends to the log with proper formatting:
--- Call 1 ---
Caller Name: Mary Doe
User Type: Teacher
School: White House Middle
Device: Chromebook
Problem: Log In Issue
Location: Classroom
Notes: Issue resolved remotely.
	also maybe
	

Additional Features to Consider

Auto-Formatting for Caller Name and Computer Name
	is this not already done ;_; (?)
	
Auto-insert spaces or newlines after "Caller Name:" or "Computer Name:" to prevent formatting issues.
	is this not the above suggestion too? -.-
	
Call Log Export

Add an "Export Call Log" button to generate a clean PDF or CSV file of the day's logs for reporting purposes.
	maybe if users suggest it
