possible changes:

Pre-Populated Problem Suggestions
When selecting a specific device or location, automatically suggest common issues based on past logs (e.g., "MacBook" suggests "Battery Issue").
	the logic for this would have to be extensive and very well throught out. should we then and a layer by grouping common issues by categories such as : Hardware, software, network, etc. then how would that fit into grouping further by device type. will device type come first, or after issue category. for now lets not do this. my coworkers can come up with that logic over time if they decide to use this app and want those changes. 

User Preferences
Add a settings menu where users can customize colors

UI possible or planned changes 

Dropdown Design

Use custom-styled dropdowns or larger dropdowns for better visibility if the list is long. 
	The lists gets long but for now we might just want to make them abc order so that users can get used to the list order over time with the help of the abc presumtion of terms. 

Dynamic Banner

Allow users to change the banner image or upload their own, similar to how you added your dog.

Icon Buttons

Replace or complement button labels with icons for a modern and intuitive touch (e.g., a floppy disk icon for "Save").

Clicking on your dog's photo could trigger a fun pop-up (e.g., "Woof! You're doing great work!").
	cute but this can come later 

Custom Fonts
	user choice. no crazy fonts
Experiment with slightly more modern or playful fonts for the headers (but keep them professional).
