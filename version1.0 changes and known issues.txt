changes since version 0.8
The code has been updated to address the following issues:

Dropdown selections (Town, Device, Problem, Location, User Type) now retain their default options and update properly without removing the first option.
The "Caller Name" and "Computer Name" buttons place the cursor directly at the input point for user convenience.
The call log numbering now works consistently, only incrementing when "New Call Log" is clicked, regardless of other buttons being clicked.

issues:
none. at all. its perfect.
