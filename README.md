current build is a python script that creates a GUI app that has choices and buttons to add to a text box. this is to help with taking notes when I take helpdesk phones calls at work. 
Plan is to create a executable that I can drop down into my workstation PC and run the app while I take phone calls. 
app outputs to a log directory that is created int he same folder the main script or executable file is at.
